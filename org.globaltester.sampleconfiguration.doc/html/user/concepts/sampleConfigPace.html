	<h1>PACE</h1>
	
	<p>
	The tab <b>PACE</b> allows to provide details needed for <b>PACE</b> during the test execution.
	</p>
	
	<div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="img/sampleConfigPace.png" align="middle"></div>
	
	<p>
	The section <b>Protocol support</b> allows to select whether or not the sample supports PACE at all.
	If you don't check the box <b>PACE</b> all other options on this tab are irrelevant. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The section <b>Supported passwords</b> allows to select which passwords (according to BSI TR-03110) are supported.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The section <b>Supported features</b> describes which variants of PACE are supported according to the following descriptions:<br>
	<b>ECDH</b> PACE based on elliptic curve cryptography<br>
	<b>DH</b> PACE based on Diffie-Hellman<br>
	<b>GM</b> PACE with generic mapping<br>
	<b>IM</b> PACE with integrated mapping<br>
	<b>CAM</b> PACE with chip authentication mapping<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The section <b>Preferred parameters</b> allows to enforce use of specific parameters for the tests.
	The field <b>OID</b> allows to force the use of a specific PACE-OID to be used. This requires that the sample supports this OID according to EF.CardAccess.
	The field <b>Domain Parameter</b> allows to force the use of a specific PACE domain parameter set, by providing its id as HexString. This requires that the sample supports this domain parameters according to EF.CardAccess.
	The field <b>Invalid Password ID</b> needs to specify a password id that the chip will reject.
	The checkbox <b>Force static binding between PACE and TAv1</b> must be checked iff the sample uses Documentnumber instead of PACE ephemeral key in TA.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>NOTE:</b> In accordance with the implemented test specifications samples that support more than one PACE configuration need to be tested using each of these!
	This implies you need to run the appropriate tests (with all parameters in the section <b>Preferred parameters</b> set) for different configurations.
	</p>
