	<h1>EACv1 Certificates</h1>
	
	<p>
	The tab <b>EACv1 Certificates</b> allows to provide details on certificates needed for <b>TerminalAuthentication v1</b>.
	</p>
	
	<div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="img/sampleConfigEac1Certificates.png" align="middle"></div>
	
	<p>
	The dropdown <b>Choose which certificates to use</b> shall be self-explanatory.
	Based on the selection here you need to either fill the next section or the one after that.
	You can select between either <b>static certificates</b> or <b>generated certificates</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Selection of <b>generated certificates</b> above allows all testcases to be executed but requires a few steps for preparation.
	First you need to define the directory path where the required certificate chains shall be generated. 
	This can be entered/selected in the field <b>Certificates directory</b>.<br/>
	In order to make all required certificates available within that folder you need to configure appropriate root certificates within the preferences (See <a href="../../../../com.secunet.globaltester.prove.epp.doc/html/eacV1_certificates.html">here</a> 
	 for details). Afterwards you need to run the generation scripts from your script bundle.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>NOTE:</b> In accordance with the implemented test specifications samples that support migration of TA cryptosystem need to be tested for each allowed target cryptosystem!
	This implies you need to run the whole test set again after the migration based on the new configuration. This new configuration will require you to build a new appropriate SampleConfig.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Selection of <b>static certificates</b> reduces the number of executable testcases (essentially only those with positive TA) but is still feasible if you can't provide root certificates/keys.
	The fields <b>DV certificate</b> and <b>IS certificate</b> shall point to the appropriate certificates.
	The field <b>IS key</b> shall point to the matching terminal private key.
	</p>
